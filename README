NOTE: 
The project only initializes some hardware for now. A system monitor was implemented but not tested yet. 
It will serve as a safety mechanism as we are dealing with a lot of heat and nobody wants to die due to 
a tiny PCB heater. Well... I guess nobody wants to die anyway.

However as mentioned only a few initializations are made and nothing more. This is the first commit of 
embedded code and the project is work in progress, so don't expect to much yet. To make the ESP32 connect 
to your WiFi, create a file named "HP_Credentials.h" in the include directory and add following lines:

#ifndef HP_CREDENTIALS_H
#define HP_CREDENTIALS_H

/* WiFi credentials */
#define MY_SSID "YOUR SSID"
#define MY_PWD "YOUR WIFI PASSWORD"

#endif
